# Homework 3 - SI 364 F18

### Deadline: October 14, 2018 at 11:59 PM

## To submit

* Fork and clone this repository.
* Submit the link to your fork to the Canvas assignment as specified on Canvas.

## Instructions

There are a number of tasks to complete, mainly in the `SI364W18_HW3.py` file, in order to replicate **[this application](http://sample364hw3.herokuapp.com/)** locally.

Each of the things you need to do is marked and described inside the `SI364W18_HW3.py` file, with a comment including **`TODO 364`**. For some, there are also hints provided.

**NOTE:** If you don't already have your text editor set to *wrap* lines, you should change it so that it does -- that will make it MUCH easier to read the instructions. You can do that in the menu *View > Toggle Soft Wrap* in Atom and similar in Sublime Text.

The majority of the 1000 total points for this assignment come from, approximately in order:

* The correct view functions to fill in that are provided (`index`, `see_all_users`, `see_all_tweets`)
* Creating the form and custom validation for it
* Defining the models
* Adding the `longest_tweet` route properly (see instructions in the file)
* Doing the app setup (e.g. creating a database) according to the instructions

However, that is *not* the order in which you should complete these tasks, because some can't be done without the others!

*We will not grade code that does not run.* Make sure yours runs, even if it does not have every feature you want in it.

**We recommend this approximate order of tasks:**

* Consider and write/draw out the things you'll need to do and how data will move through the application. Make sure you understand the problem(s) at hand, and read through all the comments describing the assignment.
* First do all the app setup. Make sure you've created a database, etc, and fill in that URL...
* Define the form and test it out.
* Define your models.
* Work on, and then test, your scaffolded view functions, including making the database queries (which you can also check with the Flask shell as shown in class!)
* Add the `longest_tweet` view function and corresponding template.
* Test it all again.


## Files and structure included

### Provided:

* Custom errorhandler routes for 404 and 500 errors
* Custom error templates 404.html and 500.html
* Other templates:
    * `base.html` (the basis from which others inherit)
    * `index.html`
    * `all_users.html`
    * `all_tweets.html`
* Necessary import statements and some parts of necessary app setup
* Scaffolding comments inside `SI364W18_HW3.py`

### You should add:

* A form class definition
* Model class definitions
* A bunch of code, as specified in the `SI364W18_HW3.py` file
* 1 template (see the instructions for `longest_route` at the end of the .py file)
* Comments at the top of your file specifying anyone with whom you worked on this HW

**Important:** (This HW is not exactly like any from past semesters, but note that it is unethical to use others' work from this semester or other semesters or to look at old semester's work and use it as your own.)

You should *not* change any file names or edit provided templates.
